My name is Nicholas Yuan and I am a PhD candidate on the Institute of Information Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

This is a place called Musings on AI to share my excitement about Deep Learning and with some interesting things such as travel or fashion.

I am happy to help in any way and glad to get in touch!

我叫袁凤程，目前在中科院信工所数据分析组做自然语言处理，本网站主要会更新深度学习相关内容，与一些自己感兴趣的东西，欢迎保持联系。
