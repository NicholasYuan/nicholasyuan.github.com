<!--Centrarium is a custom theme for Jekyll, made by [Ben Centra][bencentra] for his own blog. He'd be humbled if you liked it enough to use it as well! Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).

This page is a good place to write about yourself, your project, your product, or whatever it is your site is for. You can replace the image above, or you can get rid of it entirely. 

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/). And you can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) -->

This is a place called Musings on AI to share my excitement about Deep Learning.

<!-- I studied Computer Science at Stanford University, where I worked on probabilistic models for NLP, and UC Berkeley, where I worked on a popular cluster-computing framework called Spark. -->

<!-- I started WildML to share my excitement about Deep Learning. I am still learning myself, but I found that writing posts and tutorials is the best way to deepen my own understanding. Topics I am currently excited about are Natural Language Understanding and Reinforcement Learning, so these will account for most of the posts on here.

I also have a personal blog where I write about startups, software engineering, and life in general. I enjoy traveling and I’ve lived in Asia (Japan, South Korea, Thailand) for several years. I am happy to help in any way I can so don’t hesitate to get in touch! -->
