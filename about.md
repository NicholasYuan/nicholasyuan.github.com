My name is Nicholas Yuan and I am a PhD candidate on the Institute of Information Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

This is a place called Musings on AI to share my excitement about Deep Learning. 

I am happy to help in any way and glad to get in touch!

我叫袁凤程，目前在中科院信工所数据分析组做自然语言处理，欢迎联系。
